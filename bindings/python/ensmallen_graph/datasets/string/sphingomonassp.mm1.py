This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph Sphingomonas sp. MM1.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the STRING repository. 

Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-02 21:39:02.109794

The undirected graph Sphingomonas sp. MM1 has 3829 nodes and 315376 weighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is dense as it has a density
of 0.04303 and has 7 connected components, where the component with most
nodes has 3812 nodes and the component with the least nodes has 2 nodes.
The graph median node degree is 133, the mean node degree is 164.73, and
the node degree mode is 5. The top 5 most central nodes are 745310.G432_11300
(degree 1510), 745310.G432_03490 (degree 1336), 745310.G432_08965 (degree
1127), 745310.G432_02905 (degree 1062) and 745310.G432_11165 (degree 1036).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.string import SphingomonasSp.Mm1

    # Then load the graph
    graph = SphingomonasSp.Mm1()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
